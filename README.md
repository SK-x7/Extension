The task was assigned by WAMessager for the role of Full Stack Developer to build a Chrome extension for WhatsApp Web within 2 days. The key requirements were:

1. Allow the user to see translated messages of the original message in their preferred language.
2. Enable the user to translate their current text into any language before sending.
3. Ensure the extension is user-friendly, with the ability to set preferred languages once, allowing the extension to work consistently across all chats.

What I Learned: I gained valuable experience in how Chrome extensions work, learned about Google's extension API, and understood how to efficiently interact with the DOM in real-time.

I completed the task and submitted on time but lets see if i get selected. To be honest chances are less.
